Installation Process Feedback: 
###################################

Anaconda not in default location – cannot use windows scripts to launch and install. - Amendment added to the user manual. 

* Command line instructions –
* if MADByTE is downloaded from Git, the main directory changes from "madbyte" to "madbyte-main". 
    This changes the command line instructions with respect to directory navigation in the install functions

* Need to add paragraph explaining how to open a terminal in Mac. 
    Suggested: “Navigate to the folder “madbyte-main” (that’s what my folder was called, not “madbyte” as you have it in the manual), right-click, and click “New Terminal Tab at folder” to open up a terminal/console to enter the following commands:”

* Design function to change tooltips according to status (selected NMR output…ect..)- IN PROGRESS

* Redo list population to show most recently generated full annotation network first. - Not Done

* Success prompt should not appear to be an error message. - COMPLETED

* Error code when canceling the file selection in bioactivity layering. - COMPLETED

* If NMR Data Directory and Project Dir are the same, flag an error - COMPLETED

* Add ability to reprocess data fully - Not done
    Currently, it checks the project dir to see if an analysis has already been completed. It would be beneficial to create a prompt to either 're-run analysis' or 'cancel'

* Remove restriction to view network until MADByTE is run if existing analysis is selected as the project dir. - Not Done
